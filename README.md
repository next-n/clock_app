# clock_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

#Real working clock with different timezones and no hard-coded data for flags and timezones except default one(Yangon/Myanmar).
#This application is mainly based on apis.
#If access to specfic api for different timezone failed, this will return to default.

#APIS
1. http://worldtimeapi.org (for different timezones)
2. https://nominatim.org (for country code for each timezone)
3. https://countryflagsapi.com (for flag using country_code returned from nominatim)
